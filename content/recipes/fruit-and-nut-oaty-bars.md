#### Ingredients
- 10 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into cubes
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 3 Tbsp honey
- 1 2/3 cups oats
- 1 cup dried fruit, such as cherries, cranberries, or raisins
- 1/2 cup hazelnuts, toasted and chopped

#### Instructions  
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  
Place the butter, sugar, and honey in a medium pan over low heat and heat gently, stirring occasionally, until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved.  

Remove from heat and stir in oats, dried fruit, and nuts.  Press the mixture into a lightly greased 8"x12"x2" non-stick roasting pan and bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.  

Allow to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then score lightly with a knife into 12 bars.  Leave to cool in the pan before removing.
