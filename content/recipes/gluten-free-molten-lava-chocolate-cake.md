#### Ingredients
- 4 oz semisweet or bittersweet chocolate
- 4 tablespoons extra virgin coconut oil (plus a little more for greasing the ramekins)
- 2 eggs 
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon coconut flour

#### Instructions
Preheat oven to 375F. Grease four 6oz ramekins with coconut oil. If you wish to serve these cakes on a plate, you will need to flour as well (coconut flour or cocoa powder).

Melt chocolate and coconut oil over low heat or a double boiler. Stir until smooth and let cool.

In a small bowl, beat eggs, vanilla, salt and sugar with a hand mixer until light and frothy, about five minutes.  

Pour egg mixture over chocolate. Sift cocoa and coconut flour over the top. Then gently fold all the ingredients together.

Pour batter into prepared ramekins (they  should be filled to within  1/2′′ of the top). Place the ramekins on  a baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake for 11-12 minutes.  Remove from oven and serve immediately.
